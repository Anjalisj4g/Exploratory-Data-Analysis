# Exploratory Data Analysis
In this project, I have used various methods of exploratory data analysis detailing information about  the employees in various team based on a dataset from ABC company. The requirement of the company is to create a comprehensive report detailing information about their employees across various teams. 
## Features :
The dataset is all about the details of employees regarding their Name, Team, Number, Position, Age, Height, Weight, College and Salary. The dataset contains 458 rows and 9 columns. The aim of the project is metioned below : 
* Determine the distribution of employees across each team and calculate the percentage split relative to the total number of employees.
* Segregate employees based on their positions within the company.
* Identify the predominant age group among employees.
* Discover which team and position have the highest salary expenditure.
* Investigate if there's any correlation between age and salary.
* Represent all the above information visually.
### How it works
